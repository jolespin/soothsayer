I've tried to make installation as seemless as possible.  There are several R dependencies that are difficult to install but it should be working through conda [OSX and Linux soon]

Current installation method:

```bash

```

Let me know if you have any issues before creating an issue on GitHub (jespinoz[ a t ]jcvi[ d o t ]org)
