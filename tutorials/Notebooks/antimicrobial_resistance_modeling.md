_______________________

The following traverses the methods associated with *Espinoza, Dupont et al. TBD*.  
In particular, this is designed to showcase the usage of the *Soothsayer* Python 3 packages, *Clairvoyance* executable for feature-selection, building/training/evaluating HEC graphical models, and advanced plotting methods.


### Tables of Contents:
_______________________
 * I. Training and testing datasets
 * II. Determine hierarchical topology for HEC graphical models
 * III. Partition sub-model training data for *Clairvoyance* feature selection on compute server
 * IV. Selecting gene-set and hyperparameter configurations for each sub-model
 * V. Architecture and construction of HEC graphical models for MOA prediction
 * VI. Evaluating model performance at various hierarchies
 * VII. Generating relevant figures using *Soothsayer*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, and *networkx*

**Code and data are privately available for reviewers and will be open-sourced after publication.**
