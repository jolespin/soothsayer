# Note, once I have more time and create soothsayer v1.0 then I will make all of this formatted consistently

# Changes:
# ========
* 2020.04.30 Make soothsayer_visuals its own package


# Clairvoyance: 
# =============
* Remove name in output files
* Add weights in the synopsis file
* Remove feature type from synopsis names

# Bugs:
# =====
* 2019.12.06 For some reason adjusting something in regression broke the ability to do sy.r_wrappers.philr.normalize_philr  but you can still do from soothsayer.r_wrappers import philr

# __future__:
* Make HierarchicalClassifier its own package
# Make soothsayer_visuals its own package
# Make soothsayer_networks its own package?
* Make PGFCs generalizable 
* Made depndencies of many utilities on soothsayer_utils instead.  Need to do this with other submodules as well
* Hive plot, fix the labels and make option for being more circule instead of super long
* Add all of the checkm markers in the database. 
* Change `create_pca_model` to something else...
* Collapse topology so it uses Agglomerative instead
* Clean up the coloring (map_colors, scalarmapping_from_data, etc.)
