# ===========
# DEVELOPMENT
# ===========
Once I have more time and create soothsayer v1.0 then I will make all of this formatted consistently

# ========
# Changes:
# ========
* 2021.03.22 Deprecated some KEGG databases because versions couldn't be confirmed.  Added a read_kegg_json in soothsayer.io.  Fixed an error with the MANIFEST.in not including sub-directories in db and non-.pbz2 files such as the .flat and .json files
* 2021.03.05 Added edgeR's exactTest, edgeR's glmLRT, and fixed np.all incompatibilities (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/40259)
* 2021.01.21 Added `markerscale=2` to LEGEND_KWS
* 2021.01.13 Finally removed `WGCNA` dependence.  I have recoded all of the necessary functions in Python.  This will make installation much easier.  New functions include: density, heterogeneity, centralization, scalefree_topology_estimation, and an updated determine_soft_threshold.
* 2021.01.06 Added `differential_abundance` to `statistics` using `ALDEx2` in `r_wrappers`
* 2020.12.16 Fixed a ddof=0 and ddof=1 incompatibility.  Now all ddof=1 in compositional package.
* 2020.09.17 Fixed LinAlgError in plot_compositional from seaborn update to v0.11
* 2020.07.21 Reimplemented PrincipalCoordinatesAnalysis and PrincipalComponentsAnalysis classes (and base classes).  They now have the ability to plot biplots, get loadings, and get contribution of feature classes to each PC.
* 2020.07.21 Added `add_objects_to_globals` function to add objects from accessory packages like hive_networkx, ensemble_networkx, soothsayer_utils, and compositional
* 2020.07.01 Created EnsembleAssociationNetwork class
* 2020.06.15-30 Make hive_networkx its own package.  Moved Symmetric and Hive (along with other functions)
* 2020.05.04 Adapted code to support py3.7/8 and rpy2 v3.x.  I only ran a few tests so hopefullyt his doesn't break
* 2020.05.20 Fixed nx.add_path deprecation for Hierarchical Classifier
* 2020.05.20 Created "infer_tree_type", "check_polytomy", "prune_tree", and "is_leaf" in utils. 
* 2020.05.20 Changed "name_ete_nodes to "name_tree_nodes" (made skbio compatible) and moved to utils
* 2020.05.20 Made dependency on `compositional`.  Replaced transform functions in `soothsayer.transmute.normalization` and added functions in `soothsayer.symmetry`.
* 2020.05.20 Removed automatic maximum threads for WGCNA
* 2020.06.01 Removed dependencies on R packages but rpy2 is still necessary
* 2020.06.04 Added "component_type" to `alpha_diversity`

# Clairvoyance: 
# =============
* Remove name in output files
* Add weights in the synopsis file
* Remove feature type from synopsis names
* Change `attributes` to `features`

# Bugs:
# =====
* 2019.12.06 For some reason adjusting something in regression broke the ability to do sy.r_wrappers.philr.normalize_philr  but you can still do from soothsayer.r_wrappers import philr

# __future__:
* Make HierarchicalClassifier its own package
# Make soothsayer_visuals its own package
* Make PGFCs generalizable 
* Change `create_pca_model` to something else...
* Collapse topology so it uses Agglomerative instead
* Clean up the coloring (map_colors, scalarmapping_from_data, etc.)
* Move TemporalNetwork to Ensemble NetworkX
